# 0x09. Web Infrastructure Design

This repository contains whiteboard designs and explanations for four foundational web infrastructure setups: a simple single-server stack, a distributed three-server system, a secured and monitored infrastructure, and a scaled-up enterprise architecture. The goal is to understand how web applications are deployed, scaled, secured, and made resilient in real-world scenarios.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `0-simple_web_stack`: One-server web infrastructure design
- `1-distributed_web_infrastructure`: Distributed multi-server infrastructure with load balancing and replication
- `2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure`: Three-server secured infrastructure with firewalls, SSL, and monitoring
- `3-scale_up`: Enterprise-grade scaled infrastructure with component separation and load balancer clustering

## üìå 0. Simple Web Stack

### üß± Components Used

- 1 **Server** (IP: `8.8.8.8`)
- 1 **Web Server**: Nginx
- 1 **Application Server**
- 1 **Database**: MySQL
- 1 **Codebase**
- 1 **Domain Name**: `www.foobar.com`

### üåê Flow Explanation

1. The **user** sends a request to `www.foobar.com`.
2. A **DNS lookup** translates `www.foobar.com` to IP `8.8.8.8` (a `CNAME` or `A` record).
3. The request reaches the **web server (Nginx)** on the server.
4. Nginx forwards the request to the **application server**.
5. The **application** (e.g., PHP, Python) queries the **MySQL database** if needed.
6. The app returns data to the **web server**, which then responds to the **user**.

### üìñ Key Concepts

- **Server**: A physical or virtual machine running services (Nginx, MySQL, etc.)
- **Domain Name**: Human-readable alias for an IP address.
- **DNS Record**: The `www` in `www.foobar.com` is typically a **CNAME** or **A** record.
- **Web Server**: Handles HTTP requests and responses (Nginx).
- **Application Server**: Runs dynamic content and business logic.
- **Database**: Stores persistent application data.
- **Communication**: HTTP(S) over TCP/IP from browser to server.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues

- **SPOF (Single Point of Failure)**: Only one server ‚Äî if it crashes, everything is down.
- **Maintenance Downtime**: Restarting any part of the stack causes unavailability.
- **No Scalability**: Cannot handle traffic spikes.

## üìå 1. Distributed Web Infrastructure

### üß± Components Used

- 3 **Servers**:
  - 2 **App/Web Servers**
  - 1 **Load Balancer** (HAProxy)
- 1 **Web Server** (Nginx)
- 1 **Application Server**
- 1 **Load Balancer** (HAProxy)
- 1 **MySQL Database** (Primary/Replica setup)
- 1 **Codebase**

### üåê Flow Explanation

1. The **user** requests `www.foobar.com`.
2. DNS resolves the domain to the **Load Balancer IP**.
3. The **load balancer (HAProxy)** distributes the traffic to one of the two backend servers.
4. The **web server** (Nginx) handles the request and passes it to the **application server**.
5. The **application** queries the **Primary MySQL DB** (writes) or **Replica** (reads).
6. The response flows back to the user.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Load Balancer

- **Algorithm**: Round Robin (default)
- **How it works**: Alternates requests between servers to distribute load evenly.

### üîÑ Active-Active vs Active-Passive

- **Active-Active**: All servers are live and handle traffic simultaneously.
- **Active-Passive**: Only one server handles traffic; the other stands by for failover.
- This setup is **Active-Active** for web/app servers, but **Primary-Replica** for the DB.

### üóÑÔ∏è Primary-Replica Database

- **Primary (Master)**: Handles writes/updates.
- **Replica (Slave)**: Syncs from master, handles reads.
- Improves performance and availability.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues

- **SPOF**: Load balancer (if not replicated).
- **Security**: No firewall or HTTPS in current setup.
- **Monitoring**: No visibility or alerting systems.

## üìå 2. Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

### üß± Components Used

- 3 **Servers** (each with identical components)
- 3 **Firewalls** (one per server)
- 1 **SSL Certificate** (for HTTPS)
- 1 **Load Balancer** (with SSL termination)
- 3 **Web Servers** (Nginx)
- 3 **Application Servers**
- 3 **Databases** (MySQL)
- 3 **Monitoring Clients** (Sumologic/DataDog agents)

### üåê Flow Explanation

1. **User** makes HTTPS request to `www.foobar.com`.
2. **DNS** resolves to load balancer IP.
3. **Firewall** filters malicious traffic before load balancer.
4. **Load Balancer** terminates SSL and distributes requests.
5. **Server Firewalls** provide additional filtering per server.
6. **Web/App Servers** process requests and query databases.
7. **Monitoring Agents** continuously collect metrics and logs.

### üîí Security Components

#### Firewalls
- **Purpose**: Filter network traffic and block malicious requests
- **Placement**: One before load balancer, one per server
- **Function**: Access control, attack prevention, network segmentation

#### SSL Certificate
- **Purpose**: Enable HTTPS encryption for data protection
- **Benefits**: Data encryption, server authentication, user trust
- **Location**: Installed on load balancer

### üìä Monitoring

#### What Monitoring Is Used For
- **Performance Tracking**: Response times, resource usage, throughput
- **Issue Detection**: Early problem identification
- **Security Monitoring**: Detect attacks and unusual activity
- **Capacity Planning**: Understanding scaling needs

#### How Monitoring Collects Data
- **Agents**: Software on each server collects system metrics
- **Log Analysis**: Web server logs, application errors
- **Network Monitoring**: Latency, connectivity, packet loss
- **Custom Metrics**: Business-specific KPIs

#### Monitoring Web Server QPS
1. Configure Nginx access logs with timestamps
2. Use monitoring agent to parse log files
3. Count requests per second from logs
4. Create QPS dashboard in monitoring tool
5. Set up alerting for abnormal QPS levels

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues

#### SSL Termination at Load Balancer
- **Problem**: Unencrypted traffic between load balancer and servers
- **Risk**: Internal network vulnerability
- **Better Approach**: End-to-end encryption or SSL pass-through

#### Single MySQL Write Server
- **Problem**: All write operations go through one database server
- **Risk**: Performance bottleneck and single point of failure
- **Better Approach**: Master-master replication or database clustering

#### Identical Server Components
- **Problem**: Resource waste, larger attack surface, maintenance complexity
- **Risk**: Components compete for resources, inefficient scaling
- **Better Approach**: Separate database servers, specialized roles

## üìå 3. Scale Up Infrastructure

### üß± Components Used

- 4 **Servers**:
  - 2 **Load Balancers** (HAProxy cluster)
  - 1 **Web Server** (Nginx)
  - 1 **Application Server**
  - 1 **Database Server** (MySQL)
- **Component Separation**: Each service type on dedicated servers

### üåê Flow Explanation

1. **User** makes HTTPS request to `www.foobar.com`.
2. **DNS** resolves to load balancer cluster Virtual IP (VIP).
3. **Active Load Balancer** (HAProxy) receives and distributes request.
4. **Web Server** (Nginx) handles static content or forwards dynamic requests.
5. **Application Server** processes business logic and dynamic content.
6. **Database Server** provides data for application queries.
7. Response flows back through the chain to the user.

### üîÑ Load Balancer Cluster

#### Why Add Second Load Balancer
- **High Availability**: Eliminates load balancer as single point of failure
- **Redundancy**: Automatic failover if primary load balancer fails
- **Maintenance**: Zero-downtime updates and maintenance
- **Performance**: Can handle more concurrent connections

#### Configuration
- **Active-Passive Setup**: One active, one standby HAProxy
- **Virtual IP (VIP)**: Shared IP that floats between load balancers
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring and automatic failover

### üèóÔ∏è Component Separation

#### Why Separate Components
- **Performance Isolation**: No resource competition between services
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale each tier based on specific demand
- **Specialization**: Optimize each server for its specific workload
